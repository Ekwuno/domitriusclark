I'm an Advocate Engineer for Cloudinary. For the past three years I've written a bunch of React UI's through a few Philadelphia based companies. I run the [Reactadelphia](https://meetup.com/reactadelphia) meetup and love building and helping setup strong communities. I'm also an instructor for [Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/domitrius-clark).

I work on tools that make onboarding & using Cloudinary easier for React developers. Highly recommend checking out the [React hooks](https://github.com/domitriusclark/use-cloudinary) I cooked up if you're looking to integrate Cloudinary in to your React projects. 

Otherwise you'll often find projects here using NextJS, GraphQL, & Apollo.

Best place to reach me is definitely my twitter [@domitriusclark](https://twitter.com/domitriusclark). I'm always open for questions around DevRel, tools that I use/write, building a community, or bootcamps. :heart:
